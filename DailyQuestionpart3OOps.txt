1.What is oops stands for?
2.What is Polymorphism? explain types?
3.what is interface and example in selenium,java?
4.what is abstarct class and example?
5.Difference between multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance
6.Is multiple inheritance possible in java?
7.What is keyword for using inheritance  
8.what is the keyword to connect interface and class
9.what is difference between class and interface
10.what is difference between class and abstract class

1.oops stands for object oriented programming language.

2.polymorphism is one of the oops concept that allows us to perform a single action in different ways(or) multiple form of implementation.
  i.method overloading
  ii. method overriding

3.An interface in java is a blueprint of a class.it has a static contants and abstract methods. The interface in java is a mechanism of achieve abstraction.
eg in selenium:Webdriver

4.Abstract class is a restricted class that cannot be used to create object.
eg:Vehicle parent class with truck and motorbike inheriting from it

5. The difference between multiple and multilevel inheritance is that Multiple inheritence is when class inherits from many base classes while multiple inheritence is when class inherits
from a derived class making that derived class a base class for a new class.

6.The java programming language supports multiple inheritence of type, which is the ability of a class to implement more than one interface.but we don't use this multiple inheritence.

7.The keyword used for inheritence is extends.

8.Implements 

9.A class describes the attributes and behaviours of an object.An interface contains behaviours that a class implements.

10.abstract class may or may not contain abstract methods.class cannot contain an abstract method.
